## Reporting a Vulnerability

The NanoTrack team takes security bugs in NanoTrack seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Issues feature in our repository. If you prefer to discuss the issue in private, you may contact the project maintainers directly through the GitHub contact feature. Please include the word "SECURITY" in the issue title to ensure it receives prompt attention.

We'll endeavor to confirm receipt of your report within 24 hours, and provide a timeline for the fix and disclosure process after the initial confirmation.

## Security Update Policy

After a security issue has been reported, we will work to:

- Confirm the issue and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance which we believe are affected.

Security updates will be released as patches to the affected versions as soon as possible. We'll notify all users about the availability of the security patches through the usual channels for software updates.

Thank you for helping keep NanoTrack and our users safe.
